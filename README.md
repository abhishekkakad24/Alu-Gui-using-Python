# Alu-Gui-using-Python
The ALU GUI (Arithmetic Logic Unit Graphical User Interface) is a program written in Python using the Tkinter library. It provides an interactive interface that allows users to perform a variety of arithmetic and logical operations on two input numbers.

The graphical user interface is designed using tkinter library with a background image and input/output labels and text boxes for user input and output display. The user can input two numbers in the respective text boxes, select an operation from a drop-down menu, and click the "Calculate" button to perform the operation and display the result in the output text box.

The ALU GUI supports a variety of operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, bitwise AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR, NOT, shift left, shift right, rotate left, rotate right, decimal-binary conversion, binary-decimal conversion, binary-octet conversion, binary-hexadecimal conversion, hexadecimal-binary conversion, octet-binary conversion, decimal-hexadecimal conversion, decimal-octet conversion, octet-decimal conversion, hex-decimal conversion, oct-hex conversion, 1's complement, 2's complement, greatest common divisor (GCD), and least common multiple (LCM).

The ALU GUI is designed to be user-friendly, allowing users to perform arithmetic and logical operations quickly and easily. The program is flexible and can be easily modified to support additional operations or to improve the user interface.
